-- Fast install for Linux Mint (or equivalent) --

This install assumes that the current directory is where this file is located.

There are a few dependencies that must be checked before compiling imgv.
Some dependencies are packages, some are actual code you must compile.
The full instructions for dependencies are in the file other/README.

Execute theses commands:

---
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake-curses-gui libopencv-dev libpng12-dev libavutil-dev
sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev libav-tools libglew-dev doxygen
sudo apt-get install tcl-udp

cd other/glfw-3.0.1 && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make && sudo make install && cd ../../..

cd other/oscpack_1_1_0 && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make && sudo make install && cd ../../..

echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib" >> ~/.bashrc
---

At this point, make sure you exit and restart a new terminal, so the new installed libraries are seen by bash. Go to the imgv directory containing this file.

Then execute these commands:

--
mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make && sudo make install
--

To test, just execute:

playImage

The indian head should show up. Move the mouse over the image and press 1,2,3,4 to distort the image.

The documentation will be installed here:

file:///usr/local/share/imgv/docs/html/index.html

That's it!
