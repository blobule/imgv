\ingroup plugins

This plugins lets images go through at a specific rate. It supports starting at a
predefined time, pause, and various events to control fading, for exemple.<br>
This plugin must be used when intending to play a video at a controled speed.


Ports
-----

|      # | Name | Direction | Description |
| ------ | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0      | in   | in        | queue d'entr√©e des images + messages |
| 1      | out  | out       | queue de sortie des images |

Events
------

| #    | Name  | Description |
| ---- | ----  | ----------- |
| none |       | no specific event by default |

Events can be defined using specific (`/event`) commands.


OSC initialization-only commands
------------

### `/fps <doulbe fps>`

  Set the framerate. This must be specified during the initialization.

### `/start <int time>`

  Start the output of images at the specified time.<br>
  A time with a small number (<1000000) indicates a time relative to "now"
in seconds. 
A large number indicate an absolute time in epoch format (in seconds).<br>
This command ends the initialization of the plugin.

### `/predisplay-first`

  Display the first image immediately. All the other images will be displayed at their scheduled time.
  The default behavior is not to predisplay.

OSC _after-initialization_ commands
------------


### `/fpsnow <double fps>`

  Change the fps for a new value.<br> This is done _now_, so there is no way to
synchronize multiple drip instances.<br>

### `/fps <double timeReference> <double fps>`

  Change the fps for a new value.<br> The _timeReference_ specifies the exact absolute time when the fps is changed. This allows the synchronization of the framerate change between sperate instances of the plugin.<br>Note that the command is executed when it is received, so
it should be queued with the images to take effect at the right time.


### `/pause <double timeReference>`

Stop (or restart) the flow of images.<br>This is essentialy equivalent as setting the fps to 0.<br>
The _timeReference_ specifies the exact absolute time when the flow is stopped, 
for synchronization purposes.<br>
Note that the command is executed when received, so it should be queued properly with the
images.



OSC _anytime_ commands
------------

### `/debug <bool T|F>`

  Turn debugging on/off.

### `/event/clear`

  Clear all events (actually, only the beginFrame and endFrame events).

### `/event/set/begin <string beginEventName> <int beginEventFrame>`

  Set the event _beginEventName_ to be triggered when the image _frame-since-begin_ is
between 0 and _beginEventFrame_.<br>
This is used to generate fadein events.

### `/event/set/end <string endEventName> <int endEventFrame>`

  Set the event _endEventName_ to be triggered when the image _frame-until-end_ is
between _endEventFrame_ and 0.<br>
This is used to generate fadeout events.

### `/dup <portName> <view>`

  Ask for a duplicate of each image on the specified _portName_ and set a specific _view_. <br>
 Attention: the duplicated image is sharing its data with the original image. No data copying is performed, so it is suggested to use the duplicate image as read-only.

  Only one dup is allowed at any time (for now).

### `/nodup`

  Stop duplication of images setup by `/dup`.

Example 1
-----------

Start playing a movie in 3 seconds, at 30 images per second.

~~~
/fps 30.0
/start 3
~~~

Example 2
-----------

Setup fadein and fadeout of 30 images at the start and end of the movie.<br>
During the beginning 30 frames of the movie, an event -100 will be generated with $xr set to
values interpolated between 0 and 1.<br>
During the ending 30 frames of the movie, an event -101 will be generated with $xr set to
values interpolated between 0 and 1.<br>

~~~
/devevent -100 2 "/set/main/A/fade" "$xr"
/devevent -101 2 "/set/main/A/fade" "$xr"
/event/set/begin -100 30
/event/set/end -101 30
~~~
